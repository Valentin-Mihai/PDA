 Median Filter is useful in computer vision for removing "salt and pepper" error. The implementation of median filter to CPU using Bubble sort algorithm. Also, implementation is being done on GPU with and without shared memory. The performance comparison is being done for image recreation. Three different images are being used to get the output and compare results for median filtering: chineseguy.bmp, mona.bmp and einstein.bmp. 

Output:chineseguy_lessNoise.bmp, mona_lessNoise.bmp, einstein_lessNoise.bmp
